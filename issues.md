1. Missing Fields in Backend Model:

The personal-info-form.tsx includes many fields that are completely absent from your UserModel:

- country (Country of Residence)
- address
- state
- city
- zipcode
- languages (Spoken Languages)
- petOwner
- countriesVisited
- countriesToVisit
- about (User's bio/description)
- idNumber (The actual number of the verification ID)
Fields related to verification status/file upload (implied by the form)

# 2. Field Mismatches & Confusions:

Gender:
Frontend: Allows "Male", "Female", "Other", "Prefer not to say".
Backend: Strictly enforces enum: ['male', 'female']. This will cause errors if the frontend sends other values.
Name:
Frontend: Uses a single name field in the profile form (though signup uses firstName, lastName).
Backend: Uses separate first_name and last_name. While manageable, it requires consistent handling on the frontend.
Emergency Contact vs. Verification ID:
Frontend: Has fields for emergencyNumber (a phone number) AND verificationType (ID type like Passport, License, National ID).
Backend: Has emergency_contact defined as an enum: ["International Passport", "NIN", "Drivers License"]. This backend field incorrectly uses the name "emergency_contact" for storing the type of verification ID. It does not store an emergency phone number. This is highly confusing.
Phone Numbers:
Frontend: Has phoneNumber and emergencyNumber.
Backend: Has phone_number1 and phone_number2 (both optional). The mapping isn't clear. Is emergencyNumber meant to be phone_number2?
Recommendation:

To ensure data consistency and avoid potential errors, I strongly recommend updating the backend UserModel to better reflect the frontend's data requirements:

Add Missing Fields: Incorporate all the fields listed above that are present in the frontend but missing in the backend model (address, city, state, zip, languages, etc.).
Resolve Gender Mismatch: Decide whether to restrict the frontend options to 'Male'/'Female' or expand the backend enum to include 'Other' and potentially 'Prefer not to say' (storing null or a specific value).
Fix emergency_contact:
Rename the backend field emergency_contact to something clear like verification_id_type.
Update the enum values if needed (e.g., use "National ID" instead of "NIN" if that matches the frontend).
Add a new field for the actual emergency contact number, e.g., emergency_phone_number (String, optional).
Add verification_id_number: Add a field to store the ID number itself (String, optional).
Clarify Phone Numbers: Consider renaming phone_number1 and phone_number2 to something more descriptive like primary_phone and secondary_phone (or emergency_phone if that's the intent for one of them).
Consider Verification Status: Add fields like is_verified (Boolean) and potentially verification_document_url (String) if you plan to store uploaded ID documents.
By making these changes, your backend model will be much more aligned with your frontend design, leading to a more robust and maintainable application.
