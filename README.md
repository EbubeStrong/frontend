# Roots n Routes - Travel Platform

## Overview

This project is a web application called "Roots n Routes," designed as a comprehensive travel platform, likely focusing on destinations and experiences in Africa (suggested by names like "Naija Experience" and "Roots Blog"). It allows users to explore, plan, and potentially book various aspects of their travel.

## Tech Stack

*   **Framework:** Next.js 15 (using the App Router)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **UI Library:** React 19
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **Components:** shadcn/ui (built on Radix UI primitives)
*   **State Management:** React Context (specifically for Authentication)
*   **Icons:** Lucide React

## Architecture Overview

The application utilizes the Next.js App Router for file-based routing and server/client component rendering.

*   **Routing:** Handled by directories within the `app/` folder. Each folder represents a route segment, and `page.tsx` files define the UI for that segment. Dynamic routes use bracket notation (e.g., `[city]`).
*   **Layouts:** The root layout (`app/layout.tsx`) sets up the basic HTML structure, global styles, and context providers (like `AuthProvider`). Nested layouts can be defined within route segments.
*   **Components:** Reusable UI elements are located in `components/`.
    *   `components/ui/`: Contains base components generated by `shadcn/ui`, providing accessible and customizable primitives.
    *   `components/`: Contains custom components built specifically for this application, often composing `ui` components.
*   **Styling:** Primarily uses Tailwind CSS utility classes for rapid UI development. Global styles are defined in `app/globals.css`. The `cn` utility from `lib/utils.ts` helps merge Tailwind classes conditionally.
*   **State Management:** Global authentication state is managed via React Context in `contexts/auth-context.tsx`. Local component state is handled using React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.).
*   **Utilities & Data:** Helper functions reside in `lib/utils.ts`. Static data, like navigation items, is currently stored in `lib/navigationData.ts`.
*   **Static Assets:** Images and icons are stored in `public/images/`.

## Core Features

The application is structured around several key travel-related features:

*   **Exploration:** Destinations (`/destinations`), Accommodation (`/accommodation`), Flights (`/flights`), Experiences (`/experiences`), Deals (`/deals`).
*   **User Management:** Authentication (`/auth/signin`), User Profile (`/profile`), Viewed Recently, Messages (`/messages`), Wallet (`/wallet`).
*   **Content & Community:** Blog (`/blog`), Community Forum (`/community`), Help Center (`/help`), FAQs (`/faqs`).
*   **Partner Opportunities:** Vendor Portal (implied), Event Ticket Selling (`/tickets`).

*(Note: Some features are represented by routes/components but may require further implementation).*
